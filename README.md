One sentence  Robot Proposal :
A robot has to navigate from point A to point B. 
The environment is simulated through a matrix where 0 is terrain that can be crossed a 1 is an obstacle that must be avoided. 
The matrix is stored on a file or, if reading the file ends up being too slow, on a variable in memory.
The robot can move only in 8 directions (up, down, left, right and diagonals).
